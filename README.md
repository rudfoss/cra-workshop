# Workshop: Practical React with Typescript Code

This is the source code used during the course [Workshop: Practical React with Typescript](https://www.bouvet.no/kurs/kategorier/utvikling-for-web-og-mobil/workshop-praktisk-react-med-typescript)

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js > v10](https://nodejs.org/en/) (recommend latest LTS version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or another IDE if you prefer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Optional:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Once prerequisites are installed follow these steps to get up and running quickly:

1. Open a terminal in your projects folder (or wherever you wish to create the root folder for this code).
2. Clone this repo to your machine `git clone https://github.com/rudfoss/cra-workshop.git`. (I recommend you choose a shallow path without spaces).
3. Open the folder `cd cra-workshop`.
4. Create a branch to work in `git checkout -b course-code`
5. Install dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`.
6. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the application.
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your preferred browser to view the app.
